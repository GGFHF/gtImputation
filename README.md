# gtImputation (Genotype Imputation)

gtimputation (Genotype Imputation) is an application designed to determine the genotypes of missing data
in a VCF or tabular format file using a machine learning procedure based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) called SOM imputation.
In addition, the application is also designed to perform a naive imputation method.

Refer to the gtImputation manual (https://github.com/GGFHF/gtImputation/blob/master/Package/gtImputation-manual.pdf)
for installation instructions, a description of the software and examples of use. Also, you can see the paper:
